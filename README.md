## Superviced Learning
### Part-1 : Artificial Neural Networks
I have learned funcamentals of ANN from this section

### Part-2 : Convolutional Neural Networks
This section explained how convolutional neural network works

### Part-3 : Recurrent Neural Network
RNN plays the game when sequance is there

## Unsupervised Learning
### Part-4 : Self Organizing Maps
This is very interesting topic. This is the first encounter for unsupervised learning using DL. Elegent but simple

### Part-5 : Boltzmann Machines
This is advanced but wonderfull concept

### Part-6 : Auto Encoders
Auto Encoders are very helpfull when you want to reduce the dimensionality, feature creation and noise reduction
